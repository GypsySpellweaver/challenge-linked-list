/*
 * create a cmp enum type to handle the results of comparisons.
 * Comparison functions should return one of three values:
 *      less    if the left-hand arg is less than the right-hand arg
 *      equal   if the left-hand arg and right-hand arg are the same
 *      greater if the left-hand arg is greater than the right-hand arg
 * A signed integer would work, but the use of enum forces it to be one
 * of the three always.
